    <h2><img class="headericon" src="../shared/keyboard.svg" /> Using the Keyboard</h2>
    <p>The Apple //e keyboard was very similar to the Mac keyboard, and most keys correspond directly between the two keyboards. However, there were a few keys on the Apple //e that are not on the Mac; these are described below:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><a name="KeyboardReset"></a>Reset</dt>
        <dd>On the Apple //e, you could usually press <span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">Reset</span> to interrupt a running program. Mariani emulates this with the <span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">F12</span> key combination.</dd>
        
        <dt><a name="KeyboardOpenApple"></a>Open Apple</dt>
        <dd>The <span class="key">&nbsp;<img class="key" src="../shared/apple.svg" />&nbsp;</span> key was first introduced in the Apple //e, and was later renamed to the Apple key. Like the <span class="key">Control</span> key, it was meant to be used in conjuction with another key to trigger an alternate action. This key is emulated with the left <span class="key">Option ⌥</span> key, which is in the same position as the <span class="key">&nbsp;<img class="key" src="../shared/apple.svg" />&nbsp;</span> key on the original //e.</dd>

        <dt><a name="KeyboardSolidApple"></a>Solid Apple</dt>
        <dd>The <span class="key">&nbsp;<img class="key" src="../shared/apple.fill.svg" />&nbsp;</span> key was introduced on the Apple //e and later renamed to the Option key. This key is emulated with the right <span class="key">Option ⌥</span> key, which is in the same position as the <span class="key">&nbsp;<img class="key" src="../shared/apple.fill.svg" />&nbsp;</span> key on the original //e.</dd>

        <dt><a name="KeyboardCapsLock"></a>Caps Lock</dt>
        <dd>On start-up, Mariani always begins with the Apple II's Caps Lock enabled, regardless of the current state of the Mac's Caps Lock key.
            <ul>
                <li>Assuming Caps Lock is off, when you press the Mac's Caps Lock key the first time, this will enable the Mac's Caps Lock. Mariani will see this but remain in the Caps Lock enabled state.</li>
                <li>Now pressing the Mac's Caps Lock key a second time, Mariani will disable Caps Lock and allow lower-case to be used.</li>
                <li>Subsequent toggling of the Mac's Caps Lock key will continue to be tracked and replicated by Mariani.</li>
            </ul>
        Of course, for lower-case you must be emulating a //e, Enhanced //e or cloned //e (so not a II or II+).</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The following key combinations are not sent to the emulated computer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">Tab</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">Shift</span>+<span class="key">Tab</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">←</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">→</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">↑</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">↓</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">Esc</span></li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2px"><span class="key">Control</span>+<span class="key">Shift</span>+<span class="key">Esc</span></li>
    </ul>
