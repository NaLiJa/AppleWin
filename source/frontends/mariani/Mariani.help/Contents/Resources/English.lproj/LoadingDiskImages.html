        <h3 class="howto">To insert a floppy disk image</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on one of the circles corresponding to the floppy drive you want to insert the disk image into.<br/><br/>A tip that indicates the slot and drive number will appear if you hover over the circle. You'll generally want to insert into Slot 6 Drive 1.</li>
            <li>Click "Other Disk..."</li>
            <li>Navigate to the disk image you want to insert, and click "Open".</li>
            <li>If you are inserting a disk image in response to program instructions, just follow those instructions. But if you're starting a new program, you can reboot the emulator from the File menu, or issue a <span class="command">PR#6</span> command to boot from slot 6 if the BASIC prompt is available.</li>
        </ol>
